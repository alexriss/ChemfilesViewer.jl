# ChemfilesViewer

A julia library to visualize chemical molecules and other structures in the [Chemfiles](https://github.com/chemfiles/Chemfiles.jl) format.

The javascript rendering is based on [Patrick Fuller's imolecule](https://github.com/patrickfuller/imolecule).

Currently, a new [Blink](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Blink.jl) window is opened for rendering. Integration into [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is planned in the future.
